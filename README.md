# Machine-Learning-University-Course
Repository of the different challenges (midterm) during the Machine Learning course at Sapienza.

Currently, the code of the first challenge is present, which is worth 10% of the final score.

# First Challenge
The first challenge as explained in the Jupyter notebook is to clean up a dataset, perform various dataset analyzes and show the comparison between the prediction power of the Decision Tree Classifier and the Multi-Layer Perceptron algorithm (MLP).
Grade: 29/30

#### Second Challenge
The second challenge is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify lego blocks. To develop it all I used the Keras and Tensorflow framework. The challenge also required to show the most significant pixels (features) through a heatmap.
Grade: 30/30 with honors.
